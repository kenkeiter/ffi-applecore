* Initial release.

* Fixed ASL close bug.
* Updated unit tests.
* Fixed log-to-file functionality by moving file handling code to dylib. 
  jRuby (Java, specifically) uses its own internal file stream maps, so you 
  can't pass a valid file descriptor from Ruby to an FFI lib.
* API no longer supports passing in arbitrary IO objects for the above reason.
